/**
 * Station 4 — the renders.
 *
 * The picture and the position in the sequence, and nothing else.
 *
 * Each render used to carry a title, the view it was shot from and the board
 * it depicted — "Terminus novelty", "Detail", "Novelty, 1u" — beneath the
 * render that showed all three. Naming what the reader is already looking at
 * adds a line to read and a thing to keep true.
 *
 * The credit is the gallery's, not the item's, because it is the same hand
 * every time; it sits under the frame and does not change as you page. The
 * board does change, and is the one thing about a render the picture does not
 * tell you — so it sits opposite the credit, smaller, and is simply absent on
 * a render whose board is not known yet.
 *
 * No pills either: with nothing to name them, they would have read 01 to 05
 * beneath a counter already reading 01 / 05. Arrows, the counter and the
 * arrow keys are the whole control.
 *
 * The lightbox is where a render is actually judged, so it opens at fit and
 * toggles to 100% on click.

            square render left a 455px picture in a 729px box with a third of
            the width as bare ground — the render being the thing the station
            exists to show.

            Unlike the kits it contains rather than crops. These arrive in
            different shapes, and one is a tight detail with the caps at the
            frame edge; cropping to fill would cut the subject of the one shot
            that cannot spare it. So a render that is not 7:6 is letterboxed,
            which is the honest cost of a gallery that takes any shape. */}
