/**
 * Station 2 — the kits.
 *
 * A picker, not a scroll sequence: one featured kit, pills for the rest,
 * arrows either side, and left/right keys. Choosing what to look at should
 * cost a click, not a measured amount of scrolling.
 *
 * Clicking the image opens it full screen with click-to-zoom, for reading a
 * legend at 100%.
 *
 * ## The render owns the card
 *
 * It used to sit in a 56/44 split beside a column of copy, which is the wrong
 * way round: the render is the product. The frame is now square and runs the
 * card's full width, breaking out through its padding, because the card's
 * width is the hard ceiling here — it cannot widen without steepening the
 * route's bends (see `StationPanel`), so the only room left to give the image
 * was the padding.
 *
 * Not square, though the artwork is. Every kit is shot the same way — the
 * caps in the middle of a slab of concrete — and the square leaves a fifth of
 * the frame empty above the top row and about as much below the bottom one.
 * So the frame is 7:6 and fills rather than contains: it keeps the full width
 * of the caps, at the full width of the card, and the 14% it crops off the
 * height is concrete.
 *
 * This is the one frame on the page allowed to crop, and only because its
 * shape was chosen against the artwork already in hand. 16:9 would be the
 * tidier number and is what the shape of a screen suggests, but it cuts 44%
 * of the height and the base kit's F-row and 40s block are inside that.
 *
 * ## Two facts
 *
 * The name and the price, and nothing else. It carried the kit code, its
 * availability, a cap count, a summary and a note; none of that is what
 * anyone is looking at this screen to find out, and all of it was competing
 * with the render for the space. The summary survives as the lightbox's
 * caption, where there is room and someone has asked for detail.
